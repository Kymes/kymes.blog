## 📚 What I'm Up To

- 🛠 **Building a Salesforce app:**  
  My main project is a Salesforce app that will be open source and downloadable right from this GitHub. I’m storing files, documentation, and eventually metadata packages so anyone can try my app in their own org.

  I believe in learning out loud. I blog about my app-building journey, Salesforce tips, and lessons learned on [kymes.blog](https://kymes.blog).

- 👩‍💻 **Emphasizing best practices:**  
  GitHub is my platform for version control, documentation, and maintaining professional habits as I grow my dev skills.
